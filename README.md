# SpeakerRecognition
Identify speakers from a sample of their speech.
Data from http://www.openslr.org/12/
For 5 speaker classification, uses a Random Forest classiifer 
with Montecarlo and Gaussian modeling: speech.py.

For 10 speaker classification, better results are obtained using
a 5 layer neural network: speechNN.ipynb
